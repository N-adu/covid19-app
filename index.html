              <p>The first case of COVID-19 was reported Dec. 1, 2019, and the cause was a then-new coronavirus later
                named
                SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in an animal and changed (mutated) so it could cause illness
                in
                humans.
              </p>
              <p>
                As of now, researchers know that the coronavirus is spread through droplets and virus particles released
                into the air when an infected person breathes, talks, laughs, sings, coughs or sneezes. Larger droplets
                may fall to the ground in a few seconds, but tiny infectious particles can linger in the air and
                accumulate in indoor places, especially where many people are gathered and there is poor ventilation.
                This
                is why mask-wearing, hand hygiene and physical distancing are essential to preventing COVID-19.

              to help you feel better.
              Stay in touch with your doctor. Call before you get medical care. Be sure to get care if you have trouble
              breathing, or have any other emergency warning signs, or if you think it is an emergency.
              Avoid public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis.

      Self-isolation is when you do not leave your home because you have or might have coronavirus (COVID-19).

              The coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine is safe and effective. It gives you the best protection against
              COVID-19. The Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines are currently available in the UK.

              <p>
                The vaccines approved for use in the UK have met strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness
                set
                out by the independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). <br>

                Any COVID-19 vaccine that is approved must go through all the clinical trials and safety checks all
                other
                licensed medicines go through. The MHRA follows international standards of safety. <br>

                Other vaccines are being developed and they will only be available on the NHS once they have been
                thoroughly tested to make sure they are safe and effective. <br>

                So far, millions of people have been given a COVID-19 vaccine and reports of serious side effects, such
                as
                allergic reactions or clotting problems, have been very rare.

              <p>
                The COVID-19 vaccine is given as an injection into your upper arm.
                It's given as 2 doses. You will have the second dose 3 to 12 weeks after having the first dose. Both
                doses will be of the same vaccine.

                <h4>What are the side effects?</h4>
              </div>

              <p>Most side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine are mild and should not last longer than a week, such as:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>a sore arm where the needle went in</li>
                <li>feeling tired</li>
                <li>a headache</li>
                <li>feeling achy</li>
                <li>feeling or being sick</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                You can take painkillers, such as paracetamol, if you need to.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may get a high temperature or feel hot or shivery 1 or 2 days after having your vaccination. But if
                you have a high temperature that lasts longer than 2 days, a new, continuous cough or a loss or change
                to your sense of smell or taste you may have COVID-19. Stay at home and get a test.
              </p>
              <p>

              <p>
                Tell healthcare staff before you are vaccinated if you've ever had a serious allergic reaction. You
                should not have the COVID-19 vaccine if you have ever had a serious allergic reaction (including
                anaphylaxis) to:
              <ul>
                <li>a previous dose of the same vaccine</li>
                <li>any of the ingredients in the vaccine</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                Serious allergic reactions are rare. If you do have a reaction to the vaccine, it usually happens in
                minutes. Staff giving the vaccine are trained to deal with allergic reactions and treat them
                immediately.

              <p>
                The first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine should give you good protection from COVID-19 from 3 or 4 weeks
                after you've had it. However, you need to have the 2 doses of the vaccine to give you longer lasting
                protection.

              <p>
                You can still get or spread COVID-19 even if you have the vaccine, therefore it is important to:
              <ul>
                <li>continue to follow social distancing guidance</li>
                <li>if you can, wear something that covers your nose and mouth in places where it's hard to stay away

            <p>Social distancing, also called “physical distancing,” means keeping a safe space between yourself and other
              people. <br>
            
              To practice social or physical distancing, stay at least 2 metres (about 2 arm lengths) from other people
              who are
              not from your household in both indoor and outdoor spaces. <br>
            
              Social distancing should be practiced in combination with other everyday preventive actions to reduce the
              spread
              of COVID-19, including wearing masks, avoiding touching your face with unwashed hands, and frequently
              washing your
              hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

                  International travel from England is now completely legal, but strict border controls remain in place.
                  Different
                  rules apply for those arriving in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. <br><br>

                  There is currently a new ‘traffic light’ system that came into force on May 17th, that sets out
                  clearly different
                  testing and self-isolation requirements for people entering England. <br><br>

                  As the virus is still spreading in many parts of the world, people should not be travelling to amber
                  or red
                  countries. <br><br>

                  Countries on the green list pose the lowest risk, therefore passengers who have only visited or
                  transited through
                  a green list country will not be required to quarantine on arrival in England. They will be required
                  to fill in
                  the passenger locator form, provide a valid notification of a negative test result prior to travel and
                  take a
                  sequencing test on day 2 after arrival. <br><br>

                  The risk posed by individual countries will be continuously monitored and the green, amber and red
                  lists will be
                  updated regularly. <br><br>
